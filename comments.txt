The answer is that the automorphism group is the collection of all graph automorphisms of a given graph with composition as its operation. 
The order is the number of automorphisms a graph has. 
An automorphism is a mapping of the nodes to nodes such that the edge structure is identical. 
Essentially, you swap around the locations of all the nodes such that the local edge structure around each node 
is the same as the edge structure prior to moving everything around

"Order 2 means reflection, abstractly. It has an automorphism that takes the nodes to a new set of nodes and 
then applying that same automorphism again takes them back to the original configuration. Similarly, order 3 is a 3-way rotation"
"It doesn’t have more because it doesn’t have a much symmetry inherent to the structure of the graph"
"I think a way to think about it is that automorphisms are like symmetries, and large complicated objects tend to be less symmetrical. 
So 99, 14 is probably a large complicated object that is most likely not the composition of highly symmetric subgraphs for example"
